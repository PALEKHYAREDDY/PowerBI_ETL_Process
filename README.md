# PowerBI_ETL_Process
I imported 3 xlsx files - Oder2022, Order2023, OrderDetails into PowerBI and removed unnecessary columns in OderDetails tables and Appended Order2022 and Order2023 into a single table named Orders after checking if both tables share same entity. 

Inner joined OrderDetails and Orders into a OrderDetails on SalesOrderID and selected OrderDate from the new column.

This showcase my skills in ETL process and how to use data accurately for visulaization process.
